    Set the ClearResult to null and instantiate the ClearService
    Validate the HTTP exchange
        Bad? # params in uri, null authToken if one is needed, wrong http method
            Send http BAD REQUEST
            Set the clearResult object message, description, and success
        Good?
            Send the http ok
    Serialize the clearResult object
    Get response body from HTTP Exchange
    Create an OutputStreamWriter from the outputStream we get from httpExchange.getResponseBody()
    Write to response body with the serialized json we made using the OutputStreamWriter
    Flush the outputStreamWriter
    Close the outputStream
    Close the Http Exchange.getResponseBody
    Done
